# Spatial-Data-Analytics-Platform

**Fellowship Agenda** 
Develop a Geo-spatial Dashboard For All Applications
Develop a location analytics platform for geospatial data visualization,analyze for decision making.





**Objectives:** 
Customization and create your dashboards
Consume data from shapefiles,geojson,json,csv.
Display of different geospatial data sets such as Point, Line, Polygon.
Integration with GIS data services in OGC format like WMS,WMTS,WFS,WPS.
Base maps like osm,bhuvan etc.
connect to database like postgresql,mongodb etc.
integrate to GIS Servers like,Geo-server,Mapserver etc.  
Reporting by charts/pie-charts,pdf,csv etc.
Real time data visualization with map and charts and data filters. 




**Technology:**
Python for back-end
Leaflet JavaScript For mapping
Postgresql for Data Base handle 
Geo-Server publishing spatial data
**Proposal Example:**
In the present scenario, rural areas people are face different health issues than people who stay in urban areas. Reaching or getting into the hospitals when people are live in rural areas. Remote area people might not able to get nearby hospitals when emergency happen and also they don’t know travel distance, routes to get health care.



   when a health emergency occurs, patient struggles to get prompt information about the details of nearby hospital and within a distance with special facilities such as Intensive Care Unit –Computed Tomography (ICU-CT)) or special therapies along with the travel time based on the road network, the cost of basic medical facilities and what kind of immediate first aid can be provided before reaching to the hospitals. None of the available tools have the capability to provide accuracy information about the hospitals with attribute data on a single platform. A tool is required to accomplish the patient’s specifications on a single finger click. The major advantages of this tool will be to get speedy information related to the hospital on the critical time and can be treated as a life saver. This tool can support for geospatial analytics by different sectors such as agriculture, banking, governance,forest  etc..
 The aim of fellowship study is to develop a spatial dashboard tool for the patients. The tool will have potential information about to patients in the following ways: On the basis of patient’s location, information about which nearest hospital locations and also have tools for selecting within distance and  has bed available, contact information and profile of the doctor, which hospital provides best emergency facility at affordable price, what first aid can be provided, contact information about the hospitals and which hospital has ambulance services and air ambulance facility will be provided based on patient’s necessities. Further, this tool will perform symptoms grading; for example: if a patient has symptoms like chest pain or loss of consciousness will be considered in top priority symptoms and in this case insurance status will be overlooked to provide best facilities. For international medical tourism, information about hospitals with interpreter facility can be identified; best suitable inns and lodging information near to the selected hospital can be determined with this tool. Patient can also identify hospitals or centers on the basis of special facilities. Also, hospitals with less waiting period can be determined which will be based on feedbacks filled by other patients. This tool will provide information about whether the hospital is registered or its registration is elapsed and hence will be very useful to minimize quackery. With this tool, rates can be accessed based on patients income and best suitable package for the surgery along with success rates can be determined. Another important feature of this tool is to determine quality of care at the selected hospital. If they want to make an appointment with a specific doctor, they can receive a list of hospitals in which that doctor visits along with his timings. At a click of a finger, the patient can find a place which fulfills all his or her specifications.  
During the fellowship program continue to strengthen technical knowledge in remote sensing and GIS and to engage in research to improve technology knowledge in GIS and remote sensing and extend the theoretical understanding of generating and utilizing information. After completing the fellowship program, my long-term objective is to seek a teaching and research position in a research or academic institution where I can share my experience and knowledge with others excited about information technology and where I can research, identify, and provide new challenges, perspectives. My research experience, my extensive working knowledge of hardware, software. In addition, my solid grasp of underlying GIS technologies and Remote Sensing science theories will provide me the essential tools to substantially contribute to further career. I want to establish myself as a successful person as well as in research area to work in best of organization so that I can extract enormous knowledge which will help me to perform better in my life.
